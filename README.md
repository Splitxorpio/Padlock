                With the power of PHP and MySQL, I was able to make the most
                secure password locker out there. Made with Love, this is more secure than your
                phone or personal computer, and that tells alot.
            </p>
            <strong style="font-size: 15px;">How Does Padlock Work?</strong>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                It is what a password locker does, Stores Personal Info and Passwords, but this is different.
                Its no ordinary locker, this is really secure. You can store passwords,
                which can only be accessed through the id that each password is given, so if your account gets hacked,
                the person that hacked your account will still not be able to access your account unless they have
                access to the database or know the ID, and to access the database you will literally need to steal my computer.
            </p>
            <strong style="font-size: 15px;">Why Was Padlock Made?</strong>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                People tend to forget their passwords a lot. So Padlock works as a second brain for storing password
                and other personal information. It is very secure, and it is for sure better than 99% of
                operating softwares out there that have password lockers.
            </p>
